 Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px">

## 🚀 About Me

🔭 I'm Kevin Adu-Poku, a Software Engineer aiming to speciaize in Front End Web Development.

👨‍💻 I’m currently running through The Odin Project and focusing on improving my understanding of Node.js

🗣 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **public speaking**, **weight-lifting**, **reading**, and **boxing** to some fun ones like **playing smash**.

📚 I also love reading books on **personal development** & **philosophy**. My favorite ones are **Meditations** by _Marcus Aurelius_ in the genre of stoic philosphy and **Mastery** by _Robert Glover_ in the genre of personal development.

✈️ I love **traveling** too. I have been on trips to **Aruba** in _2021_ and to **Sicily, Italy** in _2022_.
